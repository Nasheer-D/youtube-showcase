YouTube Showcase is a powerful but simple-to-use YouTube video gallery plugin with responsive frontend.

== Description ==

Each video resides on its own page with WordPress comments enabled. Video pages are automatically created when you insert the YouTube VIDEO ID on the video page.

YouTube Video ID is a 11 character string that YouTube uses to uniquely identify each video. For example, the video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9K4uBRkFJEU has the id 9K4uBRkFJEU.

After you install our plugin you will see our setup assistant which creates all the required pages, ready to use.

Two Video Gallery pages are provided:

* Video Gallery
* Video Grid Gallery

<strong>Video Gallery</strong><br>
Displays the active large video with high resolution video thumbnail navigation at the bottom. Videos are paged after every 8th video. For small size devices with screen size less than 768px, thumbnail navigation is replaced with two large size PREV and NEXT icons.

<strong>Video Grid Gallery</strong><br>
Displays high resolution video thumbnails in a 4 column responsive layout.

You can build your galleries by adding the VIDEO ID for the videos youâ€™d like. You can add Content and Excerpt for every video. The video CONTENT text is displayed in the video page. The video EXCERPT is displayed in *Video Gallery* page, right below the main video.

All videos are responsive and adjusts to the container so you do not need to give height or weight.

Comes with two sidebar widgets:

* Featured Videos
* Recent Videos

<strong>Featured Videos</strong><br>
Displays the videos you selected as featured in your video page on your sidebar.

<strong>Recent Videos</strong><br>
Displays your recently posted videos on the sidebar.
